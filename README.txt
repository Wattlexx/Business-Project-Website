Project Assignment 2, Website Design by Nicholas Pinney

This Website uses Bootstrap framework by CDN and direct reference to access tools which improve the look and flow of the design.

To view the website:
	1. Open index.html in brower by double clickibng the file "index.html"
	2. Browse other pages by using the links in the navigation bar.
	3. Make sure there is an internet connection to properly load icons and JQuery features linked by CDN's as well as the Google map iFrame.

If the folders or files get moved to other directories, the webiste won't work properly as all the images and pages are linked statically based on their path in the folder BusiProj
The css and js folders are bootstrap dependencies, I have not done any work in those.
